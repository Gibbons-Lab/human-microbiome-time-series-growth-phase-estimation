Analysis script for article "Growth phase estimation for abundant bacterial populations sampled longitudinally from human stool metagenomes." 

Analysis results were verified using R version 4.1.3. Processed data used for the scripts can be downloaded from Figshare (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.19641510). Scripts that were used to simulate the stochastic logistic equation can be found in ./scripts_for_simulation.
